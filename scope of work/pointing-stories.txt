POINTING STORIES
HOW DIFFICULT/COMPLEX IS THE STORY AND HOW MANY UNKNOWNS
pointing scale based on Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8)

0 - trivial. change a typo
1 - trvial change to code but also need to change tests
2, 3 - edit code and tests that increases due to complexity
5 - considerable amount of unknowns and code manipulation
8 - a big story that has a lot of unknowns and/or complicated. after doing research/getting into it, can then potentially be broken into smaller stories
